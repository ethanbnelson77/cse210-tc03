Alma Camarillo - Bio
Hi guys! I'm Alma, and I was born in Veracruz, MÃ©xico. I'm a 22 year old sophmore studying Software Engineer with an Embedded Systems emphasis. 
I'm a sound geek and work as an Audio Engineer in training at A/V Productions in the I-Center. My dream is to be a part of the Developer teams 
that bring us EQ/Compression Sound Edit Programs. Ex. Pro Tools. Feel free to listen to my first solo on Spotify: "My Angel"- Allecaes. I like 
to create msuic on my free time, and my 1st album is still a work in progress. Cheers to you!

I am a Computer Science major currently in my third semester. My coding experience comes almost solely from the classes at this school.
I play a lot of video games as that is what I love to do.
